HW1_2nd_part

HW1_2nd_part MASTER 2 IIPE This is the first homework 2nd part for APP (Architecture and Parallel Programing) Module In the Master 2 IIPE (Informatique Industrielle, Parallèle et Embarquée) Teacher Pr Lakhdar LOUKIL

Student Ramzi El Abed

Multiply two square matrix using langage C with Eclipse IDE 202-12 in sequential mode & parallel mode (with pthread)

This is what we do in this homework :

    a Makefile has been defined.
    User has to input the dimension of the matrix
    Sequential version of mmm
    Parallel version of mmm
    We verify that parallel version is correct by comparing the result matrix with one generated using the sequential algorithm.
    we have timed the execution time and we display the result in seconds
    A README is written.
    We have commenting the programs


For Execution of the 2nd part of the HW1 :

    after downloading all the 6 files : initmatrix.c initmatrix.h multiply.h multiply.c main.c Makefile
    put it in a folder under linux
    Open a terminal from this folder
    run make command
    execute with ./hw1_ramzi_2nd_part.exe
    you will be ask to choose between sequential and parallel mode by typing (s or p), if you tape another character or number the program stop, you will have to execute it another time
    for sequential mode, you will have to input the dimension and you will have the execution time
    for parallel mode, you will have to input the dimension and the number of threads, you will get the execution time of sequential and parallel calculating, also you wil get the acceleration of the calculating and the comparison between result of sequential and parallel calculating
